    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
      
      <b>Include employees in safety routines</b> <br>

      I would advise my client to employ developers who can practice security practices and write secure codes. 
      The alternative, which is to have a security team that takes care of security, 
      can lead to problems due to security teams that are unable to keep up with the company's growth and development. <br>
      
      <b>Adopt a cyber security framework.</b><br>
      
      The purpose of adopting a cyber security framework is to implement structure and routines to ensure that the company is protected against threats and attacks.<br>
      
      <b>Implement automated security tools</b><br>
      
      If, for example, you implement a problem tracker as a security tool in your routines, you can eliminate threats and problems earlier. This could, for example, 
      be the "sanetize-html package", which you can use in Node.js. This tool cleans the HTML codes to remove dangerous threats.<br>
      
      <b>Secure authorization and strong password requirements</b><br>
      
      I would also advise my client to use strong password requirements and secure authorization, such as two-factor authorization.<br>
      
      <b>Network security</b><br>
      
      As a developer of a website, you should be careful where you connect to the internet. Sensitive information can go astray or be compressed<br>
      
      <b>user timeout on the website</b><br>
      
      If a user leaves the computer without logging out, it is nice to have automatic logout in case of inactivity. This is to prevent unauthorized persons gaining access to the user's account. In addition, when using timeout, resources will be freed up in the system, since it does not need to use resources on an inactive user.
